# Compute_H3_averages
This repo contains two MATLAB scripts: Compute_H3_averages_TSS and Compute_H3_averages_3_zones.

Compute_H3_averages_TSS generates Excel tables with the genome-wide average H3 occupancy in the window [TSS-1000, TSS+1000].

Compute_H3_averages_3_zones generates Excel tables with the average H3 occupancy in the three zones (-1 nuc., NDR, +1 nuc.) for every gene.

Usage:

    Compute_H3_averages_TSS
    Compute_H3_averages_3_zones
